# City Population Scrapper
If the population of the city is high an ad will be viewed by more times. <br>
Thus population of a city can be a factor which influences the probability of ad being clicked in that city. <br>
That is why I decided to scrap data from Wikipedia.<br>
All of the population counts are extracted from Russian Wikipedia site since all the cities don't have a page on the English Wikipedia website.<br>
